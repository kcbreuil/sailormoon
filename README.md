## Welcome to the Sailor Universe

Over the past week, we have been building full-stack applications. In your database design homework, we had you design a `sailorScoutSchema`.

Now we are going to practice using our schemas and build some routes ✨

## Getting Started

✨Clone this repo and cd into it

✨`yarn install && yarn start`

## Info

✨If you look in your server.js, you will see we have already built out your server.

✨If you look in your model folder--you will see we already have provided the model (schema) for our sailor collection.

✨If you look in your routes folder--you will see we have given you some preliminary code for two routes.

## Objective

✨Finish coding the `POST` and `GET` routes in your routes folder

✨Don't forget to add a `.env` file and add your MONGODB URL so you can have a place to store your data!

✨Using your `POST` route and the `sailorSchema` model as a reference--create three unique `sailor` documents (via Postman). You can find information for the properties for our Sailor Schema here: https://sailormoon.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters_(Crystal)

✨Using Postman, make a `GET` request to our `/sailors` endpoint, to ensure you have three sailors in your database

✨Send a screenshot to `#current-web-dev` to show your work
