## Welcome to the Sailor Universe

Over the past week, we have been building full-stack applications. In your database design homework, we had you design a `sailorScoutSchema`.

Now we are going to practice using our schemas and build some routes! ✨

## Getting Started

✨ Clone this repo and cd into it
✨ `cp .env.sample .env` and fill in `MONGODB` with an appropriate database connection string
✨ `yarn install && yarn start`

## Info

✨ If you look in your server.js, you will see we have already built out your server.

✨ If you look in your model folder, you will see we already have provided the model (schema) for our sailor collection.

✨ If you look in your routes folder, you will see we have given you some preliminary code for two routes.

## Objective

✨ Finish coding the `POST` and `GET` routes in your routes folder

✨ Using your `POST` route and the `sailorSchema` model as a reference--create three unique `sailor` documents (via Postman). You can find information for the properties for our Sailor Schema here: https://sailormoon.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters_(Crystal)

✨ Using Postman, make a `GET` request to our `/sailors` endpoint, to ensure you have three sailors in your database

✨ Send a screenshot to `#current_web_dev` to show your work!
